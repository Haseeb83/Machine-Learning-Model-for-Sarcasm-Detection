# Machine-Learning-Model-for-Sarcasm-Detection

This project focuses on detecting sarcasm in news headlines using machine learning. The dataset (Sarcasm_Headlines_Dataset_v.csv) contains labeled sarcastic and non-sarcastic headlines. Text preprocessing involves lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, and stemming. The cleaned headlines are vectorized using TF-IDF for feature extraction. The dataset is split (80% train, 20% test), and models are trained using Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Hyperparameter tuning and 5-fold cross-validation optimize model performance. Logistic Regression and k-NN use text features for sarcasm classification, while Random Forest and SVM apply advanced feature selection for improved accuracy. Model evaluation is conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Results indicate that Random Forest and SVM outperform Logistic Regression and k-NN, with enhanced accuracy due to feature engineering. Data visualization, including word clouds, histograms, and scatter plots, helps interpret sarcasm patterns. Future improvements include deep learning models (LSTMs) for contextual sarcasm understanding and real-time sarcasm detection for automated moderation.
